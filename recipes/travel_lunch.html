    <h2>Boring but good!</h2>
    <p>This is my go-to for lunch while traveling via motorcycle. It's difficult to find healthy food out on the roads, especially as you travel to more rural places. </p>
    <p>The general struture is to obtain a reasonable ratio of protein, fat, and carbs to sustain yourself while travel, while cutting down on prep time and waste, and not needing to worry about spoilage. If I have time I'll make into a wrap, but lately I've lost all modesty and won't even bother with that... read on for more...</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat - looking for 4-6 oz of beef jerky or hard salami - something that won't spoil easily.</li>
            <li>Carb - whole wheat tortilla, flour tortilla - these are energy dense and pack well. Smaller the better I've found.</li>
            <li>Cheese - usually 4oz of an aged white cheddar - kind of an indulgence, try to eat it within a day of opening.</li>
            <li>Tomato - helps add some moisture to an otherwise dry meal</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Two ways to eat this - sandwich wrap style, or barbarian style.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sandwich wrap
                <ol class="substeps">
                    <li>Cut up ingredients to fit into tortilla.</li>
                    <li>Wrap up and eat!</li>
                    <li>3-4 sandwiches is plenty filling for a lunchtime meal.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Barbarian style - who has time to be cute with making a sandwich when there's adventure to be had? 
                <ol class="substeps">
                    <li>Unwrap ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Take individual bites of one ingredient until satisfied.</li>
                    <li>Move to the next ingredient and repeat.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
