    <h1>Camping Oatmeal Breakfast</h1>
    <img src="https://www.sorbentsystems.com/images/ltfsbag.jpg" alt="This is a picture of oatmeal within a mylar bag">
    <h2>For an easy, no mess camping breakfast!</h2>
    <p>Taken from my motorcycle travels, this recipe for oatmeal has been my go-to for an easily constructed meal that is ready to eat in minutes, provides the right amount of calories and nutrition, and cleans up easily.</p>
    <p>You could easily modify the ingredients to suit your tastes, as this combination of ingredients may not be for everyone. When traveling, I'm not overly concerned with taste - "food is fuel" is the main objective, along with avoiding processed foods and needing to stop along the way to purchase food.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup oatmeal, old fashioned cut</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp nutmeg, ground</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp ginger, ground</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon, ground</li>
        <li>1 tsp cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chia seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
        <li>1 banana</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>1x mylar bag, 0.35 gal size</li>
        <li>0.25 L boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Equipment needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Food dehydrator</li>
        <li>Vacuum sealer</li>
        <li>1 bowl</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepping the bananas
            <ol>
                <li>NOTE: You certainly could avoid this step by buying dehydrated banana slices, if you don't have a dehydrator; also, I suggest buying a bundle of bananas and doing all at once, freezing the remainder of what you don't use.</li>
                <li>Juice the lemon into a bowl.</li>
                <li>Slice the bananas into small slices, around 1/8 of an inch.</li>
                <li>Briefly mix the slided bananas in with the lemon juice to coat them - this prevents browning of the banana.</li>
                <li>Load banana slices into the dehydrator.</li>
                <li>Set dehydrator temperature for 135F, and dehydrate for 10-12 hours.</li>
                <li>Before storing or using right away, measure the weight of the bananas and divide by the number of bananas used to obtain your serving weight for one banana.</li>
                <li>Once done, I store in mason jars in the freezer when not using.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Constructing the meal
            <ol>
                <li>Open up the mylar bag.</li>
                <li>Load the bag with the ingredients in this order: oatmeal, spices, cocoa, and chia seeds. Try to cover the cocoa powder in the chia seeds to prevent the cocoa dust from flying out.</li>
                <li>Load the bag with 1 banana's worth of dehydrated banana slices.</li>
                <li>Load the bag with the raisins.</li>
                <li>Seal the bag with the vacuum sealer. Oxygen absorbers may be more necessary for longer term storage or trips, but I haven't had a need for them.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Serving the meal
            <ol>
                <li>Open the mylar bag.</li>
                <li>Boil the water (I use a Jetboil exclusively for boiling water).</li>
                <li>Pour the water into the bag, stir, and close to let the water be absorbed for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the consistency is to your liking, enjoy!</li>
                <li>TIP: use the empty bag for small trash around the campsite and discard when you leave camp. </li>
            </ol>    
        </li>
        
    </ol>
