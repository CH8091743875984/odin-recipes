    <h2>Fine dining at the campsite in the evening.</h2>
    <p>Making use of a food dehydrator and taking inspiration from the backcountry hiking folks, this is my go to meal for dinner while on motorcycle camping trips. It helps me cut down on food prep, cooking time, waste, and dishwashing. Mild flavors and a lack of processed food help keep the stomach happy.</p>
    <p>As with all of these recipes, you can configure your own protein, carb, and veggie to use. Your ratio and weights and ingredients can be tailored to your own needs.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients (per meal)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>50g dehydrated cooked chicken</li>
        <li>50g dehydrated cooked white quinoa</li>
        <li>35g dehydrated mixed veggie</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp or 6 cracks of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp tumeric</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>0.75 L boiling water</li>
        <li>1 mylar bag, 1 gallon size</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Making the dehydrated components
                <ol>
                    <li>For the chicken: bake chicken breasts at 350 for 32-33 minutes, shred, dehydrate at 160 for 8-12 hours.</li>
                    <li>For the veggie: start from a frozen bag of veggies - I used carrot / corn / green bean mix - open from frozen and load directly on to dehydrator trays, dehydrate at 135 for 8 hours.</li>
                    <li>For the quinoa: cook as instructed, allow to cool, spread onto dehydrator trays as thinly as possible, dehydrate at 135 for 8-10 hours. Could be dehydrated simultaneously with the veggie. Short on time? Use couscous instead and skip the dehyrator entirely.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Preparing the meal
                <ol>
                    <li>Load all ingredients into the mylar bag.</li>
                    <li>Vacuum seal the bag, trying to make as flat as possible without puncturing the bag.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Eating the meal
                <ol>
                    <li>Unseal the bag.</li>
                    <li>Boil the water.</li>
                    <li>Fill the bag with the water, stir, reseal temporarily, and ensure the bag is supported/braced while the ingredients rehydrate.</li>
                    <li>Let stand for 10-20 minutes, checking 1-2 times for rehydration status.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
